NORMAL REQUIREMENTS TO GENERATE PROMPT

php to python converter
requriements:
header logo in top and right side theme select and help option (help they clicked we need to give how to use this tool instructions ok)
now AI configurations we get the baseurl and api key from the user thats all we nee dto fetch models from the respective AI gemini groq claude like that ok then models visible and select one and connect
Now Php to python convertor
left side php interface and right side is python interface
in php interface we are paste the code or upload the php file also
in php interface we need to give option to expact that editor to view full display 
in php interface we need to give option security standards user use that and click that and open popup and analyse that php code and fix the securoty standards using the AI and adk to user apply this securoty standard in the existing code if ok then change that php code inthe editor ok
in php side download option need to show they can download that changed file
in php side developer hints and explantion of that code option they click that then using th AI explan that editor code ok then show download option for that document 

WE Need PHP to PYHTON CONVERT option

then in python interface show that code in ediotor
in python interface we need to give option to expact that editor to view full display 
in python interface we need to give option security standards user use that and click that and open popup and analyse that python code and fix the securoty standards using the AI and adk to user apply this securoty standard in the existing code if ok then change that python code inthe editor ok
in python side download option need to show they can download that changed file
in python side developer hints and explantion of that code option they click that then using th AI explan that editor code ok then show download option for that document 

So finally two main php and python
if user focus php alone then use that and get proper code then user want to convert the python code then use that converted agenerated code get
User needs to understand even without coding knowledge user also proper flow
Impressive interface to the user easily to use the application 
Beautifuly need with theme options and proper icons look and feel need to be good



AI PROMPT GENERATOR OR CHATGPT USING TO GENERATE PROPER PROMPT


📌 Build a full-stack AI-powered "PHP to Python Code Converter" web application.

🧠 Purpose:
Create a developer-focused tool that allows users to convert PHP code into Python using AI models like OpenAI, Groq, or Gemini. The app must support code upload, real-time conversion, security checks, testing, and documentation.

---

🖥️ 1. User Interface (Frontend)

💡 Layout:
- Clean, responsive design using TailwindCSS.
- Two code editors side-by-side (Monaco Editor):
  - Left: PHP code input editor
  - Right: Python code output editor (readonly)
- Tabs for:
  - ➕ Upload File
  - 🔁 Convert
  - 📤 Download
  - 📄 Explain Code
  - 🛡️ Security Audit
  - 🧪 Testcases & Docs

🛠️ Key Components:
- Model Selection Dropdown: `OpenAI`, `Groq`, `Gemini`
- API Base URL input
- API Key input
- "Connect" button to validate and save credentials
- "Upload .php File" → loads code into editor
- "Convert" → sends code to AI for conversion
- "Download .py File" → downloads generated code
- "Explain" → shows natural language summary of PHP/Python code
- "Security Report" → scan for dangerous functions like `eval`, `exec`, `os.system`
- "Test Generator" → creates pytest functions for the output
- "Clear" → resets editor

---

🤖 2. AI Model Integration (Backend)

- Connect to selected AI model using:
  - ✅ Configurable Base URL
  - ✅ API Key
- Support the following AI Models:
  - OpenAI GPT-4.5 or GPT-3.5 (via OpenAI or OpenRouter)
  - Groq Mixtral or LLaMA models
  - Gemini Pro (Google AI)
- Use prompt templates for code conversion and explanation:
  - Convert Prompt: "Convert the following PHP code into equivalent Python code following PEP-8 and secure coding standards..."
  - Explain Prompt: "Explain what this code does in plain language..."

---

🧠 3. Features

### ✅ A. Code Conversion
- Convert PHP → Python using selected AI
- Ensure:
  - Clean, well-indented output
  - PEP-8 compliant
  - Remove insecure or unsupported patterns

### ✅ B. File Upload & Download
- Upload `.php` → load into editor
- After conversion → provide download `.py` file

### ✅ D. Code Explanation
- Click “Explain PHP Code” → AI summarizes what PHP code does
- Click “Explain Python Code” → AI explains the conversion
- Include:
  - Line-by-line breakdown
  - Use cases
  - Real-world applicability

### ✅ E. Documentation Generator
- Auto-generate:
  - Function docstrings
  - Sample inputs/outputs
  - Suggested test cases
  - Use cases
  - Developer notes

### ✅ F. Security Analyzer
- Scan PHP & Python code for vulnerabilities
- Warn for:
  - `eval`, `exec`, `os.system`, shell injection, etc.
  - Bad practice (e.g., hardcoded credentials)
- Recommend safe alternatives
- Mark risk levels (low/medium/high)

### ✅ G. Test Case Generator
- For each Python function:
  - Generate `pytest` functions with `assert` conditions
  - Provide sample values
  - Expected outputs

### ✅ H. Coding Standards
- PHP: PSR-12
- Python: PEP-8
- Show tooltips/hints for:
  - Function renaming
  - Variable casing
  - Code structuring
  - Comments and docstrings

---

📦 4. Backend Stack

- Python 3.x with Flask or FastAPI
- Use `openai`, `httpx`, or `requests` for API calls
- Use `subprocess.run()` in a sandbox to test code (disable dangerous ops)
- Optionally: isolate tests with Docker or safe REPL service

---


🧪 5. Sample Use Cases

- ✔️ Legacy migration from PHP to Python (Django/FastAPI)
- ✔️ Code cleanup and modernization
- ✔️ Teaching developers how syntax and structure differ
- ✔️ Secure API migration
- ✔️ AI-assisted pair programming

---

📚 7. Optional Add-Ons

- 🌟 Versioning: Store old conversions (locally or in DB)
- 🌟 Dark mode + Language toggle
- 🌟 Auto-save every 30 seconds
- 🌟 Team collaboration (future)

---

🧠 Example Use Flow

1. Select "Groq" as model → enter base URL + API key
2. Upload `user_login.php` → appears in PHP editor
3. Click "Convert" → Python code appears on the right
4. Click "Run" → get test output with errors or success
5. Click "Explain" → see line-by-line explanation
6. View Security Report → identify risky code
7. Download `.py` file or auto-generate test cases

---

🔐 8. Security Considerations

- Sanitize file uploads (only allow `.php`)
- Run code in secure subprocess with timeout
- Disable execution of dangerous code (`eval`, `os.system`, etc.)
- Validate AI response before allowing execution
- Escape HTML to prevent XSS in code display
- Add CSP headers if deployed on web
